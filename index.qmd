# College Colloquium Final
## Calculating Molar Mass of Chemical Compounds

The concept of **molar mass** lies at the heart of chemistry because it connects the microscopic world of atoms to the macroscopic world of measurable substances. Molar mass, measured in grams per mole (g/mol), represents the mass of one mole of a chemical substance. One mole equals \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) entities — the famous **Avogadro’s number**.  Understanding molar mass is essential because it allows chemists to convert between the mass of a substance and the number of particles it contains. This relationship is the foundation of stoichiometry, chemical reactions, and solution chemistry. For example, knowing that one mole of carbon dioxide (CO₂) has a molar mass of 44.01 g/mol allows a scientist to determine that 88.02 grams of CO₂ equals exactly two moles.  
This project uses **Python** and **Quarto** to demonstrate how programming tools like SymPy, pandas, and Matplotlib can automate and visualize chemical concepts. The goal is to calculate molar masses of different compounds, organize the results into tables, display graphical relationships, and symbolically represent the equations used in chemistry.  



## import libraries 
To perform calculations, we import several Python libraries. `SymPy` handles symbolic mathematics, `pandas` creates and manages tables, and `matplotlib.pyplot` produces graphs for visualization.

```{python}
import sympy as sp
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Define the atomic masses (amu) of the first 25 elements in the periodic table (g/mol)

## Function to calculate molar mass

```{python}
import re
def find_elements(compound):
    elements = []
    while compound != "":  #while its not empty 
        # If only one character left
        if len(compound) == 1: #seeing if there's onlyone more element  
            elements.append((compound, 1)) # adding that one element to the elements list, with a count of 1
            break # stops the loop, meaning that we are done
        # If second char is lowercase (two-letter element)
        elif compound[1].islower(): # checking if it's a two letter element 
            element = compound[0:2] # assigning the two letters to the element variable 
            if len(compound) > 2 and compound[2].isdigit(): # checking if there are still more characters and if it's a number 
                count = int(compound[2]) # if it is a number, assign that number to count 
                elements.append((element, count))
                compound = compound[3:] # its deleting the first 3 from compound (two letter element + count)
            else:#if there is no number after the two letter element 
                elements.append((element, 1))
                compound = compound[2:]
        # Otherwise single-letter element
        else:
            element = compound[0]
            if len(compound) > 1 and compound[1].isdigit():
                count = int(compound[1])
                elements.append((element, count))
                compound = compound[2:]
            else:
                elements.append((element, 1))
                compound = compound[1:]
    return(elements)

def molar_mass(formula):
    elements = find_elements(formula)    
    total_mass = 0
    for element, count in elements:
        total_mass += atomic_masses[element] * count
    return total_mass
```


## Test with some commonly used compounds
- The table below lists the calculated molar masses using atomic weights from the periodic table.
```{python}
compounds = ["H2O", "CO2", "SO2", "CaF2", "NaCl", "Cl2"]
masses = [molar_mass(c) for c in compounds]
```


## Table 1
- The table above lists the calculated molar masses using atomic weights from the periodic table.

```{python}
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Compound": compounds,
    "Molar Mass (g/mol)": masses
})
df
```

## Graph 1
```{python}
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
plt.bar(df["Compound"], df["Molar Mass (g/mol)"])
plt.title("Molar Masses of Common Compounds")
plt.xlabel("Compound")
plt.ylabel("Molar Mass (g/mol)")
plt.show()
```

## Table 2

```{python}

import re
def atom_count(formula):
    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\d*)', formula)
    total = 0
    for _, count in parts:
        total += int(count) if count else 1
    return total

df["Total Atoms"] = [atom_count(c) for c in df["Compound"]]
df
```

## Graph 2

```{python}
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
plt.plot(df["Total Atoms"], df["Molar Mass (g/mol)"], marker='o', linestyle='-')

plt.xlabel("Number of Atoms in Compound")
plt.ylabel("Molar Mass (g/mol)")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```



# Define symbols

- We can also use SymPy to represent the molar mass equation symbolically.

```{python}
n_H, n_O = sp.symbols('n_H n_O')
M_H, M_O = sp.symbols('M_H M_O')
```


# Equation for water molar mass

- This symbolic representation shows how the molar mass of water depends on its atomic components.

```{python}
M_H2O = sp.Eq(sp.Symbol('M_H2O'), 2*M_H + M_O)
M_H2O
```



# Define a symbolic equation for molar mass using SymPy

The molar mass (M) of a compound is the mass of one mole of its molecules or formula units, measured in grams per mole (g/mol).
It can be calculated by summing the atomic masses of all atoms in the compound.
Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

- M = molar mass (g/mol)
- m = mass of the sample (g)
- n = number of moles (mol)

```{python}
M, n, m = sp.symbols('M n m')
eq = sp.Eq(M, m/n)
sp.latex(eq)
```
